Geacintov is currently a Professor of Chemistry at New York University\u00a0and the Vice Dean for Science at NYU Shanghai.\u00a0He served as the Chair of the NYU Department of Chemistry for nearly ten years, and on many departmental and university committees, including the All University Promotion and Tenure committee.\u00a0He is currently the Chair of the Chemistry Faculty Search Committee for the\u00a0NYU Abu Dhabi campus, and a member of the NYU Abu Dhabi Tenure and Promotion Committee. He was trained as a polymer chemist and received his PhD from Syracuse University and the SUNY College of Environmental Sciences\u00a0and Forestry, but gradually switched fields to areas at the interface of chemistry and biology.\u00a0His current interests are in unraveling the mechanisms of the human defense mechanisms against DNA damage caused by endogenous and environmental\u00a0 chemicals, and he is co-author of over 400 research articles and the monograph Chemical Biology of DNA Damage (Wiley-VCH, 2010). He is a Fellow of the\u00a0 American Physical Society,\u00a0the American Chemical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a former President of the American Society for Photobiology, and recipient of the Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty Award for Excellence in the Sciences in 2007 (NYU).\u00a0He was a member of the Editorial Boards of the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the Journal Chemical Research in Toxicology,\u00a0and served as a member of numerous NIH review panels, including service as the\u00a0Chair of the NIH Cancer Etiology Study Section.\u00a0In addition to his administrative duties at NYU Shanghai, he currently teaches advanced undergraduate and graduate\u00a0biophysical chemistry courses at NYU New York, and supervises an active federally funded research laboratory.</p><h3>Education</h3><ul><li>PhD, Physical and Polymer Chemistry<br/>Syracuse University</li><li>MS, Physical and Polymer Chemistry<br/>Syracuse University</li><li>BS, Physical and Polymer Chemistry<br/>State University of New York</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
