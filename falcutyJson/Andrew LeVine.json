LeVine is interested in finding new ways to explore the world through photographic imaging. His recent excursions focus on fusing traditional photographic methods with new technological platforms.\u00a0Research has included in-depth use of 360 degree cameras,\u00a0stop motion development for virtual reality environments, and designing digital modules for analogue cameras. He most recently created a tool to quickly view, edit, and capture photographic negatives using the smartphone, yielding high quality images. A recent\u00a0graduate from NYU\u2019s ITP program, his work has been featured by Adobe, Vice, Gizmodo, on MTV\u2019s Times Square billboards, and in various events and exhibitions.\u00a0</p><h5>Research Interests:</h5><ul><li>Product Development</li><li>The intersection of analogue and digital worlds</li><li>New image capture techniques</li><li>Virtual Reality</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
