Dr. Lukinova\u2019s main research interest is decision-making modeling. At NYU Shanghai, she works with her supervisors Professor Jeff Erlich and Professor Steve Lehrer to improve our understanding of how stress influences economic decisions. This is done by carrying out novel language-free and language based decision-making experiments together with various measures of stress. Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, Dr. Lukinova was working as a Research Scientist at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.\u00a0</p><h3>Research Interests:</h3><ul><li>Decision making</li><li>Experimental economics</li><li>fMRI</li><li>Game theory</li><li>Models of human behavior</li></ul><h3>Education:</h3><ul><li>Ph.D., Political Science, University of Oregon</li><li>M.A., Economics, University of Oregon</li><li>M.S., Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Science and Technology</li><li>B.S., Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Science and Technology</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
