He has been Professor of Biology at NYU New York since 1993. He holds a PhD in Genetics from the University of Connecticut (1986) and an AB in Biology from Dartmouth College (1980). His postdoctoral research was in molecular phylogenetics (Wayne State University School of Medicine) and developmental genetics (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Using free-living rhabditid nematodes as model organisms, Fitch's\u00a0current research is involved in understanding how cellular morphogenesis is regulated in time and space and sex-specifically, the evolution of this process, and the phylogenetic relationships of rhabditid nematodes. He teaches general biology, developmental genetics, and evolution. Funding for his research comes primarily from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. He has published a number of articles in a variety of different journals, serves on a couple editorial boards, is a member of the Faculty of 1000, has won a couple fellowships, and is the proud recipient of a teaching award from NYU. He likes music (piano and composition), martial arts, and designing databases.</p><p>To learn more about David Fitch,\u00a0read his\u00a0<a href=\"http://shanghai.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/media/fitch_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2010 Q&amp;A</a> with <em>Current Biology.</em></p><h3>Recent Publications</h3><ol><li>Fitch, D.
