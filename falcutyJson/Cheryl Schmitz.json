She holds a Ph.D. in Sociocultural Anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BA in History and Women\u2019s Studies from Tulane University.</p><p>Schmitz takes an ethnographic approach to explore the meaning of Chinese globalization, looking specifically at connections between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the African continent. She conducted extended fieldwork with Chinese businesses in Angola, which resulted in a study of everyday encounters among various international actors brought together under a controversial Chinese-funded program for Angolan postwar reconstruction. Her writing has appeared in the Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, the Journal of Material Culture, and Concrete Flux. Her broader research interests include cultural and linguistic translation, work and consumerism, and anti-imperialist politics.</p><p>Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, Schmitz taught at the University of California, Berkeley and at Zhangjiagang Foreign Language School in Jiangsu Province. Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (2011-2014), the Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship (2016-2017), and grants from UC Berkeley.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
