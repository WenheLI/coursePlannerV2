Dr Liu\u2019s main research interest is speech and music. Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, she obtained her PhD in Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences from University College London (UCL), with a research focus on the relations between speech and music from the perspectives of dynamics, timbre and pitch. At NYU Shanghai, she works with her supervisor Professor Xing Tian on the neural bases of speech production and perception. More specifically, she mainly uses EEG (with possible combinations with fMRI and TMS) to investigate speech-related phenomena such as motor-sensory transformation in speech production, perception of speech prosody and speech monitoring through the lens of learning.\u00a0</p><h3>Research Interests:</h3><ul><li>Speech</li><li>Music</li><li>Motor-Sensory Transformation</li><li>Prosody</li><li>Phonetic aspects of language acquisition</li></ul><h3>Education:</h3><ul><li>Ph.D., Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, UK</li><li>M.Phil., Linguistics, University of Cambridge, UK</li><li>M.St., General Linguistics and Comparative Philology, University of Oxford, UK</li><li>\u200bB.A., English, Shanghai International Studies University, China</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
