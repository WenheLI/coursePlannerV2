He holds a PhD in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science from the University of Maryland, College Park and a BS in Physics from Peking University.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Professor Tian\u2019s research interests are in the areas of human cognitive neuroscience. More specifically, his research focuses on how the interaction between action and perception underlies speech, language, memory and other higher-level cognition. He uses behavioral, computational, electrophysiological (EEG, MEG, ECoG), and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods to investigate the neural mechanisms that mediate human cognition. His work has been published in Psychological Science, Current Biology, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Cognitive Psychology, Brain Topography, Frontiers in Psychology, and Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Research Interests</h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>Human cognitive neuroscience</li></ul><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Recent Publications</h3><ul><li>Tian, X., &amp; Poeppel, D.
