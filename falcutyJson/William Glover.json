In his research Will uses the concepts and tools of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, in combination with high-performance computational simulation methods to understand condensed- and gas-phase dynamics\u2014at the atomistic, \"first principles\" level\u2014that produce testable predictions with regard to measurable (e.g. spectroscopic) phenomena. He is already quite widely published including in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>.</p><h3>Research Interests</h3><p>Dr. Glover is particularly interested in applying these tools to high-profile questions such as the structure of hydrated electrons and the atomic mechanisms of energy transfer in bacterial and chloroplast photosynthetic systems, with applications to such fields as the rational design of organic photovoltaics and understanding how radiation can damage DNA.</p><h3>Recent Publications</h3><ul><li>WJG, T.
