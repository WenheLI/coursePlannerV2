Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, he was professor of chemistry at New York University and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He holds a PhD from University of Houston and a BS from East China Normal University.</p><p>Zhang\u2019s current research focus is the development and application of novel computational methods for accurate and efficient study of biological systems. He develops quantum and classical methods, including new polarized force field to accurately predict protein structure, free energy in protein-drug and protein-protein bindings, and conformational dynamics of membrane proteins, structure, and dynamics of metalloproteins, etc.</p><p>Zhang has won many awards and fellowships, including the Camille and Henry Dreyfus New Faculty Award (1990), the National Science Foundation Presidential Faculty Fellowship (1994), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (1995), and the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar (1995). \u00a0He also received Outstanding Overseas Young Scientist Award of NSFC (2001), Chang Jiang Lecture Professor of MOE (2003), and Thousand Talent program (2009).</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://chemistry.fas.nyu.edu/object/johnzhzhang.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York University Department of Chemistry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://itcs.ecnu.edu.cn/e/en/DetailGroups.php?v=3&amp;id=1499\" target=\"_blank\">East China Normal University</a></li><li><a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcp9LFUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Google Scholar</a></li></ul><h3>Courses Taught</h3><ul><li>Foundations of Science 1 Chemistry</li><li>Foundations of Science 2 Chemistry</li><li>Foundations of Science 1 Physics</li><li>Mathematics for Sciences</li></ul><h3>Education</h3><ul><li>PhD, Chemical Physics, University of Houston, 1987</li><li>BS, Physics, East China Normal University, 1978</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
